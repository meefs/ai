## 3.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#400](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/400) [`8822603`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/882260300ccbf78a8c40e5ce54a49d02c7ad3c8c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add early config validation to `createWorkersAI` that throws a clear error when neither a binding nor credentials (accountId + apiKey) are provided. Widen all model type parameters (TextGenerationModels, ImageGenerationModels, EmbeddingModels, TranscriptionModels, SpeechModels, RerankingModels) to accept arbitrary strings while preserving autocomplete for known models.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#389](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/389) [`8538cd5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/8538cd53ce2e1be28cca95217725dfd4642fd7da) Thanks [@vaibhavshn](https://github.com/vaibhavshn)! - Add transcription, text-to-speech, and reranking support to the Workers AI provider.

    ### New capabilities
    - **Transcription** (`provider.transcription(model)`) — implements `TranscriptionModelV3`. Supports Whisper models (`@cf/openai/whisper`, `whisper-tiny-en`, `whisper-large-v3-turbo`) and Deepgram Nova-3 (`@cf/deepgram/nova-3`). Handles model-specific input formats: number arrays for basic Whisper, base64 for v3-turbo via REST, and `{ body, contentType }` for Nova-3 via binding or raw binary upload for Nova-3 via REST.

    - **Speech / TTS** (`provider.speech(model)`) — implements `SpeechModelV3`. Supports Workers AI TTS models including Deepgram Aura-1 (`@cf/deepgram/aura-1`). Accepts `text`, `voice`, and `speed` options. Returns audio as `Uint8Array`. Uses `returnRawResponse` to handle binary audio from the REST path without JSON parsing.

    - **Reranking** (`provider.reranking(model)`) — implements `RerankingModelV3`. Supports BGE reranker models (`@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base`, `bge-reranker-v2-m3`). Converts AI SDK's document format to Workers AI's `{ query, contexts, top_k }` input. Handles both text and JSON object documents.

    ### Bug fixes
    - **AbortSignal passthrough** — `createRun` REST shim now passes the abort signal to `fetch`, enabling request cancellation and timeout handling. Previously the signal was silently dropped.
    - **Nova-3 REST support** — Added `createRunBinary` utility for models that require raw binary upload instead of JSON (used by Nova-3 transcription via REST).

    ### Usage

    ```typescript
    import { createWorkersAI } from "workers-ai-provider";
    import { experimental_transcribe, experimental_generateSpeech, rerank } from "ai";

    const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });

    // Transcription
    const transcript = await experimental_transcribe({
    	model: workersai.transcription("@cf/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo"),
    	audio: audioData,
    	mediaType: "audio/wav",
    });

    // Speech
    const speech = await experimental_generateSpeech({
    	model: workersai.speech("@cf/deepgram/aura-1"),
    	text: "Hello world",
    	voice: "asteria",
    });

    // Reranking
    const ranked = await rerank({
    	model: workersai.reranking("@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base"),
    	query: "What is machine learning?",
    	documents: ["ML is a branch of AI.", "The weather is sunny."],
    });
    ```

## 3.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [#393](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/393) [`91b32e0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/91b32e0b0ef543fd198ddf387b9521ac3bd9650a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Comprehensive cleanup of the workers-ai-provider package.

    **Bug fixes:**
    - Fixed phantom dependency on `fetch-event-stream` that caused runtime crashes when installed outside the monorepo. Replaced with a built-in SSE parser.
    - Fixed streaming buffering: responses now stream token-by-token instead of arriving all at once. The root cause was twofold — an eager `ReadableStream` `start()` pattern that buffered all chunks, and a heuristic that silently fell back to non-streaming `doGenerate` whenever tools were defined. Both are fixed. Streaming now uses a proper `TransformStream` pipeline with backpressure.
    - Fixed `reasoning-delta` ID mismatch in simulated streaming — was using `generateId()` instead of the `reasoningId` from the preceding `reasoning-start` event, causing the AI SDK to drop reasoning content.
    - Fixed REST API client (`createRun`) silently swallowing HTTP errors. Non-200 responses now throw with status code and response body.
    - Fixed `response_format` being sent as `undefined` on every non-JSON request. Now only included when actually set.
    - Fixed `json_schema` field evaluating to `false` (a boolean) instead of `undefined` when schema was missing.

    **Workers AI quirk workarounds:**
    - Added `sanitizeToolCallId()` — strips non-alphanumeric characters and pads/truncates to 9 chars, fixing tool call round-trips through the binding which rejects its own generated IDs.
    - Added `normalizeMessagesForBinding()` — converts `content: null` to `""` and sanitizes tool call IDs before every binding call. Only applied on the binding path (REST preserves original IDs).
    - Added null-finalization chunk filtering for streaming tool calls.
    - Added numeric value coercion in native-format streams (Workers AI sometimes returns numbers instead of strings for the `response` field).
    - Improved image model to handle all output types from `binding.run()`: `ReadableStream`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Response`, and `{ image: base64 }` objects.
    - Graceful degradation: if `binding.run()` returns a non-streaming response despite `stream: true`, it wraps the complete response as a simulated stream instead of throwing.

    **Premature stream termination detection:**
    - Streams that end without a `[DONE]` sentinel now report `finishReason: "error"` with `raw: "stream-truncated"` instead of silently reporting `"stop"`.
    - Stream read errors are caught and emit `finishReason: "error"` with `raw: "stream-error"`.

    **AI Search (formerly AutoRAG):**
    - Added `createAISearch` and `AISearchChatLanguageModel` as the canonical exports, reflecting the rename from AutoRAG to AI Search.
    - `createAutoRAG` still works but emits a one-time deprecation warning pointing to `createAISearch`.
    - `createAutoRAG` preserves `"autorag.chat"` as the provider name for backward compatibility.
    - AI Search now warns when tools or JSON response format are provided (unsupported by the `aiSearch` API).
    - Simplified AI Search internals — removed dead tool/response-format processing code.

    **Code quality:**
    - Removed dead code: `workersai-error.ts` (never imported), `workersai-image-config.ts` (inlined).
    - Consistent file naming: renamed `workers-ai-embedding-model.ts` to `workersai-embedding-model.ts`.
    - Replaced `StringLike` catch-all index signatures with `[key: string]: unknown` on settings types.
    - Replaced `any` types with proper interfaces (`FlatToolCall`, `OpenAIToolCall`, `PartialToolCall`).
    - Tightened `processToolCall` format detection to check `function.name` instead of just the presence of a `function` property.
    - Removed `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` and `zod` peer dependencies (no longer used in source).
    - Added `imageModel` to the `WorkersAI` interface type for consistency.

    **Tests:**
    - 149 unit tests across 10 test files (up from 82).
    - New test coverage: `sanitizeToolCallId`, `normalizeMessagesForBinding`, `prepareToolsAndToolChoice`, `processText`, `mapWorkersAIUsage`, image model output types, streaming error scenarios (malformed SSE, premature termination, empty stream), backpressure verification, graceful degradation (non-streaming fallback with text/tools/reasoning), REST API error handling (401/404/500), AI Search warnings, embedding `TooManyEmbeddingValuesForCallError`, message conversion with images and reasoning.
    - Integration tests for REST API and binding across 12 models and 7 categories (chat, streaming, multi-turn, tool calling, tool round-trip, structured output, image generation, embeddings).
    - All tests use the AI SDK's public APIs (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateImage`, `embedMany`) instead of internal `.doGenerate()`/`.doStream()` methods.

    **README:**
    - Rewritten from scratch with concise examples, model recommendations, configuration guide, and known limitations section.
    - Updated to use current AI SDK v6 APIs (`generateText` + `Output.object` instead of deprecated `generateObject`, `generateImage` instead of `experimental_generateImage`, `stopWhen: stepCountIs(2)` instead of `maxSteps`).
    - Added sections for tool calling, structured output, embeddings, image generation, and AI Search.
    - Uses `wrangler.jsonc` format for configuration examples.

## 3.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [#390](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/390) [`41b92a3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/41b92a34ce4d9dffba8bb42b4933bbc06e4b1aaa) Thanks [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)! - fix(workers-ai-provider): extract actual finish reason in streaming instead of hardcoded "stop"

    Previously, the streaming implementation always returned `finishReason: "stop"` regardless of the actual completion reason. This caused:
    - Tool calling scenarios to incorrectly report "stop" instead of "tool-calls"
    - Multi-turn tool conversations to fail because the AI SDK couldn't detect when tools were requested
    - Length limit scenarios to show "stop" instead of "length"
    - Error scenarios to show "stop" instead of "error"

    The fix extracts the actual `finish_reason` from streaming chunks and uses the existing `mapWorkersAIFinishReason()` function to properly map it to the AI SDK's finish reason format. This enables proper multi-turn tool calling and accurate completion status reporting.
